## Feedback gathered

### On 13/08/2021

-   There is too much going on:
    -   Using a lot of font styles
    -   Gradients for buttons, titles and backgrounds
    -   It makes it difficult to discern what is actually interactive and what is not
    -   Titles are gradients, black (in text) or white (blog)
-   On mobile, the navbar at times is triple layered and hides a lot of the screen
-   On mobile, kick the social icons when scrolling
-   When going to your non featured Blog items your first item overlaps with the bg image and there is no title
-   Give styled elements a clear purpose
-   You should showcase who you are and what your desired or current role is as the forefront of the page, in the floating navigation
-   Get rid of the secondary-level floating nav (for projects)
-   Remember, interviewers are looking through many portfolio sites and if they can’t remember who you are, and what you do, you’re going to get lost in a sea of other applications

#### Modifications to implement

-   Define a handful of styles and assign a clear purpose for each of them (there is too much elements competing for the user's attention)
    -   Don't overuse gradients
    -   Make interactive parts of the site more prominent
    -   Unify title styles
-   Include my name and position on the sticky navbar (a memorable image?)
-   Ditch the social media logos on sticky navbar for mobile
-   Ditch the secondary navbar for projects
